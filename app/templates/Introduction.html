        In this experiment, we shall see the Vernam Cipher, a perfectly secure crypto-system developed by Gilbert Vernam in 1918. This kind of encryption is truly unbreakable as long the key is maintained a secret.

    <p>
        The One-Time Pad, or OTP is an encryption technique in which each character of the plain-text is combined with a character from a random key stream. Originally described in 1882 by banker Frank Miller (USA), it was re-invented in 1917 by Gilbert Vernam and
        Joseph Mauborgne. When applied correctly, the OTP provides a truly unbreakable cipher.

    <h2 class="text-h3-darkblue"> About the experiment: </h2>
    <p>
        The main idea is to realize that any perfectly secure encryption scheme (and not just the One-Time Pad) requires the key-space to be at least as large as the message space, and is therefore <i> impractical </i> .
