        Vernam cipher is a stream cipher where the original or plain data is XOR-ed with a random (actually pseudorandom) stream of data (called the key) of the same length to generate the encrypted data. When the stream of data used as key is truly random and
        used only once, it is called a <b>one-time pad</b>. A widely used implementation of the Vernam cipher is <b>RC4</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The theory behind the OTP is that the encryption key has at least the same length as the actual message (i.e. the plain-text) and consists of truly random numbers. Each letter of the plain-text is 'added' to one element from the OTP using modulo-addition.
        This results in a cipher-text that has no relation with the plain-text when the key is unknown. At the receiving end, the same OTP is used to retrieve the original plain-text.

        Advantages:
    </h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>
            The Vernam cipher with one-time pads is the only known encryption procedure where, in theory, information is secure and can't be deciphered, if the key is randomly and only once used for encryption . For decryption, only the secret key and the encrypted
            data is used.
        </li>
        <li>
            The security of one-time pad is based on the unique use of the key and sufficient randomness of the used key. Even with increasing computing power, it can't be broken.
        </li>
        <li>
            Due to the fact that encryption is done by XOR, the algorithm is pretty fast. For decryption, the same algorithm can be used - it's symmetric.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="text-h3-darkblue">
        Disadvantages:
    </h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>
            The Vernam cipher requires a key with the same length as the original data. For example, the encryption of a hard disk requires a second hard disk (with at least the same size) to store the key.
        </li>
        <li>
            The data of the key has to be, ideally, completely randomly chosen. Most computers are not able to generate really random keys.
        </li>
    </ol>

        Working:
    </h2>
    <p>
        First, the bytes of the message are read. Then the one-time pad, i.e. the key is created by generating a truly random zero-one stream of the same length as the input message. This key is then shared between the sender and recipient.
    </p>
    <p>
        The
        <b>ciphertext</b> is generated by applying the logical XOR operation (exclusive-or) to the individual bits of
        <b>plain-text</b> and the
        <b>key</b>. For decryption, the cipher-text is XOR-ed with the same key to get back the
        <b>plain-text</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In other words:
    </p>
    <center>
        <strong>plaintext + key = ciphertext ⇒ ciphertext + key = plaintext</strong>
    </center>
    <p>
        Example:
    </p>
    <p>
        SENDING
    </p>
    <pre>
            message : 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 ...
            pad     : 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 ...
            XOR       ---------------------------
            cipher  : 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 ...
</pre>
    <p>
        RECEIVING
    </p>
    <pre>
            cipher  : 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 ...
            pad     : 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 ...
            XOR       ---------------------------
            message : 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 ...
</pre>
    <p>
        This cipher is unbreakable in a very strong sense. The intuition is that any message can be transformed into any cipher (of the same length) by a pad, and all transformations are equally likely. Given a two letter message, there is a pad which adds to
        the message to give OK, and another pad which adds to the message to give NO. Since either of these pads are equally likely, the message is equally likely to be OK or NO.
